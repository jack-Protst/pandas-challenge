Analysis
The first trend that I noticed is that an increase in spending ranges per students do not equate to a higher grade. While the difference between the $585-630 and $630-645 were small with the $630-645 having an slightly higher overall passing there is a noticable dip in the score of the $645-680 where the overall passing falls by nearly 40% with the biggest dipped being in the passing math grades within the higher budgeted range this trend seems to show that money is not the key factor to student success.
Another trend that I noticed is the size of the schools themselves with the large schools with populations of 2000-5000 having fall worse grades than the medium and small schools with the exception of Wilson High School whom among the large schools have the smallest total students releative to their school size where it has nearly 500 less than the second smallest school as well as Wilson High School having one of the lowest budgets among the large schools.
These two trends show me that a key factor in student success in school is the both the size as well as the budget of the school. From the data I would summize that increasing funding to schools will not bring better grades but rather more schools with smaller student populations.
